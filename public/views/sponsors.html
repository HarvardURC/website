                            The Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club gives students the opportunity to explore their passions outside of class. We strive to give our members the hands-on experience, creative freedom, and project ownership that they would otherwise never experience during their college years. As such, HURC plays a vital role in our members' development as engineers.

                        Building robots is fun, but it's definitely not cheap. As our club expands and affects more and more students, so does the cost of operating. By sponsoring us, you will give our members the possibility to pursue their passion in robotics and get real engineering experience.
