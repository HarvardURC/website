                          The University Rover Challenge (URC) is the world's premier robotics competition for college students.  Held annually in the desert of southern Utah in the United States, URC challenges student teams to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside astronauts exploring the Red Planet.

                            The Rover Team is a joint HURC SEDS team bring together a wider variety of engineers with different skillsets to design the future of Mars rovers. Though new as of this year, this team is already underway designing and prototyping initial rover assemblies, with the goal of having a functioning rover by the end of the academic year and to be competing in 2018.

                        This team is a joint project between HURC and the Harvard Chapter of SEDS.
                        <a href="http://seds.org/">Students for the Exploration and Development of Space (SEDS)</a> is the largest student-run space organization in the world. With 62 chapters spanning 5 countries, SEDS chapters look to educate, experiment, and discover the world of space exploration through a variety of means. Harvard SEDS was restarted in Spring of 2015 after its chapter dissolved in 2011. Harvard SEDS focuses on speaker series and hands-on projects to bring together a community of space enthusiasts on Harvard's campus.
